# hand-written-digits

## Project Overview
The `hand-written-digits` project is a MATLAB application developed during my bachelor's degree. It's designed to recognize Hindi hand-written digits. The application processes images of handwritten numbers, segments them into individual digits, and then uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method to classify each digit.

## Technology
This project is implemented entirely in MATLAB, utilizing its powerful matrix operations and image processing capabilities to handle the digit recognition process.
